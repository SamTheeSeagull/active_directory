# 00 - Install and Set up VMs

1. Downloaded and installed Windows Server 2022, and Windows 11. Windows Server 2022 is used on VMware Workstation 16, and the Windows 11 client is on Oracle VirtualBox.
2. Cloned the fresh installs so that we always have a fresh install to go back to in case we break something.
3. Made test account for Microsoft to gain access to Windows 11 installation.
